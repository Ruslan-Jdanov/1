It's a fine day, people open windows
They leave the houses, just for a short while
It's a fine day, people open windows
They leave the houses, just for a short while

It's going to be a fine night, tonight
It's going to be a fine day, tomorrow
It's going to be a fine night, tonight
It's going to be a fine day, tomorrow
